### 1. Correctness of Implementation (Post-Fixes)

I'll re-examine the relevant files to confirm the changes are correctly applied and integrated.

**Logging Components:**

*   **`libs/shared/src/logger/async-storage.ts`**: This file correctly defines `AsyncLocalStorage` to store context-specific data like the correlation ID.
*   **`libs/shared/src/logger/logger.service.ts`**:
    *   It now imports `asyncStorage`.
    *   The `getContextAndMeta` method correctly retrieves the `correlationId` from `asyncStorage` and includes it in the log metadata.
    *   This ensures all logs generated by `LoggerService` will include the correlation ID if available in the current `AsyncLocalStorage` context.
*   **`libs/shared/src/interceptors/correlation.interceptor.ts`**:
    *   Correctly imports `LoggerService` from `../logger/logger.service`.
    *   Generates a `correlationId` (either from `X-Correlation-ID` header or a new UUID).
    *   Uses `asyncStorage.run` to set the `correlationId` for the duration of the request.
    *   Logs "Request started" and "Request finished" using the injected `LoggerService`, which will now automatically include the correlation ID.
*   **`apps/api-gateway/src/common/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts`**:
    *   Correctly imports `LoggerService` from `@app/shared/logger/logger.service` and `MetricsService` from `@app/shared/metrics/metrics.service`.
    *   It's now injected with both `LoggerService` and `MetricsService`.
    *   Logs request details (method, URL, status code, duration) using `this.logger.log` and `this.logger.error`. These logs will now be structured and include the correlation ID.
    *   Records `httpRequestDuration` metrics using `this.metricsService.httpRequestDuration.observe`.
*   **`libs/shared/src/interceptors/interceptors.module.ts`**:
    *   Correctly imports `CorrelationIdInterceptor` and `LoggerModule`.
    *   `imports: [LoggerModule]` correctly makes `LoggerService` available to `CorrelationIdInterceptor`.
    *   `providers: [CorrelationIdInterceptor]` makes the interceptor available.
    *   `exports: [CorrelationIdInterceptor]` makes it available for other modules to import.
*   **`apps/api-gateway/src/app.module.ts`**:
    *   Correctly imports `InterceptorsModule`.
    *   Registers `CorrelationIdInterceptor` globally using `APP_INTERCEPTOR`. This ensures it runs for every incoming HTTP request.

**Metrics Components:**

*   **`libs/shared/src/metrics/metrics.service.ts`**:
    *   Correctly defines `usersCreatedCounter` (a `Counter`) and `httpRequestDuration` (a `Histogram`).
    *   These are initialized with appropriate names, help texts, and label names.
*   **`libs/shared/src/metrics/metrics.module.ts`**:
    *   Correctly imports `MetricsController` and `MetricsService`.
    *   `providers: [MetricsService]` makes the service available for injection.
    *   `exports: [MetricsService]` makes it available for other modules to import.
*   **`apps/user-service/src/user.service.ts`**:
    *   Correctly imports `MetricsService`.
    *   The `create` method now injects `MetricsService` and calls `this.metricsService.usersCreated.inc({ provider: 'local' });` after a user is created. This correctly increments the custom metric.

**Conclusion on Correctness**: The recent changes have successfully integrated structured logging, correlation IDs, and custom metrics into your application. The dependency injection issues have been resolved, and the components are correctly wired up.

### 2. How They Work

#### Logging (Application -> File -> Promtail -> Loki -> Grafana)

1.  **Application Logging**:
    *   When an HTTP request comes into the `api-gateway`, the `CorrelationIdInterceptor` runs first. It generates a unique `X-Correlation-ID` (or uses an existing one from the request header) and stores it in `AsyncLocalStorage`.
    *   The `LoggingInterceptor` then runs. It uses the `LoggerService` to log details about the request and response. Because `LoggerService` is integrated with `AsyncLocalStorage`, every log message generated during that request automatically includes the `correlationId`.
    *   Any other part of your application that uses the `LoggerService` (e.g., `UserService`, `BookingService`) will also have its logs enriched with the `correlationId` for the current request.
    *   The `LoggerService` (configured with `winston`) writes these structured JSON logs to `logs/app.log` (or service-specific log files as configured in `promtail-config.yml`).

2.  **Log Collection (Promtail)**:
    *   `promtail` (running as a Docker service) is configured to "tail" (monitor) the log files generated by your application services (e.g., `/app/logs/api-gateway.log`, `/app/logs/user-service.log`).
    *   As new log lines are written, Promtail reads them, adds labels (like `job: api-gateway`), and sends them to the Loki service.

3.  **Log Storage (Loki)**:
    *   `Loki` receives the log streams from Promtail and stores them. Unlike traditional log aggregators that index the full text of logs, Loki indexes only metadata (labels) associated with log streams. This makes it very efficient for storage and querying.

4.  **Log Visualization (Grafana)**:
    *   `Grafana` is configured with `Loki` as a data source (`grafana-datasources.yml`).
    *   You can access Grafana's "Explore" feature, select the Loki data source, and use LogQL (Loki's query language) to search and filter your logs. For example, `{job="api-gateway"} |= "error"` would show all error logs from the API gateway. You can also filter by `correlationId` to see all logs related to a specific request across microservices.

#### Metrics (Application -> Prometheus -> Grafana)

1.  **Application Metrics Exposure**:
    *   The `MetricsService` (in `libs/shared/src/metrics`) defines custom metrics like `usersCreated` and `httpRequestDuration`.
    *   The `MetricsController` exposes these metrics (along with default Node.js/NestJS metrics) at the `/metrics` endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/metrics` for the API Gateway).
    *   Your `UserService` now increments the `usersCreated` counter when a new user is created.
    *   The `LoggingInterceptor` records the duration of HTTP requests into the `httpRequestDuration` histogram.

2.  **Metrics Collection (Prometheus)**:
    *   `Prometheus` (running as a Docker service) is configured (`prometheus.yml`) to periodically "scrape" (pull) metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint of your application services (e.g., `api-gateway:3000/metrics`).
    *   Prometheus stores these time-series data points.

3.  **Metrics Visualization (Grafana)**:
    *   `Grafana` is configured with `Prometheus` as a data source (`grafana-datasources.yml`).
    *   You can create dashboards in Grafana using PromQL (Prometheus's query language) to visualize your metrics. For example, `rate(users_created_total[5m])` would show the rate of new user creations over the last 5 minutes.
    *   You can also visualize HTTP request durations, error rates, and more.

### 3. How to Test Them

To test the logging and metrics, you'll need to run your Docker Compose environment and interact with your application.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Docker and Docker Compose installed.
*   Your application's dependencies installed (`npm install`).

**Steps:**

1.  **Start the Docker Compose Environment**:
    Open your terminal in the `bookify` root directory and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    This will build your services (including the updated code) and start Loki, Promtail, Prometheus, and Grafana.

2.  **Generate Logs and Metrics (Interact with your API Gateway)**:
    *   **Access the API Gateway**: Your API Gateway should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   **Make some HTTP requests**:
        *   Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` to make requests to your API Gateway. For example, try to create a new user (this will trigger the `usersCreated` metric).
        *   Make a few successful requests and a few requests that might cause errors (e.g., invalid input) to generate different types of logs and metrics.
        *   Example `curl` command to create a user (adjust payload as per your `CreateUserDto`):
            ```bash
            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}' http://localhost:3000/users/signup
            ```
        *   Make a simple GET request:
            ```bash
            curl http://localhost:3000/some-public-endpoint # Replace with an actual public endpoint
            ```

3.  **Verify Logs in `logs/app.log` (Optional, for direct file inspection)**:
    You can check the `logs` directory in your project root. You should see `app.log` (or service-specific logs if you've configured them in `winston`). Open these files to see the JSON-formatted logs, including the `correlationId`.

4.  **Access Prometheus Metrics**:
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:9090`.
    *   In the "Expression" field, type `http_request_duration_seconds_count` and click "Execute". You should see the count of HTTP requests.
    *   Type `users_created_total` and click "Execute". You should see the count of users created.
    *   You can also explore other metrics like `process_cpu_seconds_total` to see basic process metrics.

5.  **Access Grafana Dashboards**:
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4000` (Grafana).
    *   **Login**: Use `admin`/`admin` (or whatever you configured in `docker-compose.yml`).
    *   **Explore Logs (Loki)**:
        *   Click on the "Explore" icon (compass) in the left sidebar.
        *   In the "Datasource" dropdown, select "Loki".
        *   In the LogQL query field, try:
            *   `{job="api-gateway"}`: Shows all logs from the API Gateway.
            *   `{job="api-gateway"} |= "Request started"`: Filters for specific log messages.
            *   `{job="api-gateway"} | json | correlationId="<your-correlation-id>"`: If you copy a correlation ID from a log, you can paste it here to see all logs for that specific request.
            *   `{job="user-service"} | json | level="info"`: Shows info logs from the user service.
    *   **Explore Metrics (Prometheus)**:
        *   Click on the "Explore" icon again.
        *   In the "Datasource" dropdown, select "Prometheus".
        *   In the PromQL query field, try:
            *   `users_created_total`: Shows the total count of created users.
            *   `rate(users_created_total[5m])`: Shows the rate of user creations per minute.
            *   `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`: Shows the buckets for HTTP request durations.
            *   `sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count{code="500"}[5m]))`: Shows the rate of 500 errors.

By following these steps, you can effectively test and observe your newly implemented logging and metrics.
