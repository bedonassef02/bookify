**Bookify Improvement Plan**

**I. New Features**

1.  **Search and Filtering:**
    *   Implement event search by name, date, location, and category in the `event-service`.
    *   Add filtering for events by price, date range, and other criteria in the `api-gateway` and `event-service`.
2.  **User Reviews and Ratings:**
    *   Create a new `review-service` for users to rate and review events.
    *   The `event-service` will calculate and display average event ratings.
3.  **Social Sharing:**
    *   Add social media sharing buttons to the event details page.
4.  **Waitlist/Watchlist:**
    *   Allow users to join a waitlist for sold-out events.
    *   Enable users to add events to a watchlist for update notifications.
5.  **Discount/Coupon System:**
    *   Implement a system for creating and applying discount codes to bookings.

**II. Bug Fixes & Refinements**

1.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Standardize error handling across all microservices for consistent responses.
    *   Implement a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack) to aggregate logs.
2.  **Security Enhancements:**
    *   Audit the `user-service`'s authentication and authorization logic.
    *   Implement rate limiting on the `api-gateway` to prevent abuse.
    *   Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
3.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Analyze and optimize database queries in all services.
    *   Implement caching for frequently accessed data like event details and user profiles.
4.  **Code Quality:**
    *   Enforce stricter linting rules for code consistency.
    *   Increase unit and integration test coverage.

**III. General Enhancements**

1.  **API Documentation:**
    *   Generate comprehensive API documentation using Swagger or Compodoc.
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
3.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Implement a monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track microservice health.
    *   Set up alerts to notify the team of issues.
